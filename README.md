# Data Structure Algorithms

This is a collection of various coding challenges depending organized by data structures. This has been separated into 2 folders. The MainApp folder contains the Xcode projects that only use a single file where all of the code is found.

The UnitTest folder is new. It contains projects where there are unit test targets to make testing the algorithms easier. I hade 2 folders since I didn't want to change the existing ones.
