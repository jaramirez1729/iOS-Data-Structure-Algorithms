# Data Structure Algorithms

This repo contains a large collection of coding challenges.

## Main App Algorithms Folder
This folder was the original project. It contains a project specific to various data structures: arrays, graphs, hash tables (dictionaries), heaps, linked lists, queues, stacks, trees, and tries. It does not use unit tests to test functions, but instead uses the main file for running algorithms which is why I don't use it anymore as it's inneficient.

## Leetcode Algorithms Folder
These are coding challenges from LeetCode that are grouped by data structure. They contain unit tests for each algorithm. It also contains company specific projects such as Facebook Interview which is based on LeetCode's Facebook interview questions.

## Cracking the Coding Interview Folder
These questions are based off the popular book, Cracking the Coding Interview. It contains several projects based on chapters for coding questions.

## iOS Interview Folder
This project contains iOS specific interview questions such as:

- How would you implement the hitTest function?
- Given 2 CGRects, create a function that returns true if they intersect, otherwise false.
