// MARK: - Triple Steps
/*
 A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.
 
 Hints:
 - Approach this from the top down. What is the very last hop the child made?
 - If we knew the number of paths to each of the steps before step 100, could we compute the number of steps to 100?
 - We multiply the values when it's "we do this then this." We add them when it's "we do this or this."
 - What is the runtime of this method? Think carefully. Can you optimize it?
 - Try memoization as a way to optimize an inefficient recursive program.

// LEBOWITS
// Sounds like a permutation problem. How many ways can you make N using 1s, 2s, and 3s?
// N = 1 -> [1] = 1 path
// N = 2 -> [1, 1], [2] = 2 paths
// N = 3 -> [1, 1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [3] = 4 paths
// N = 4 -> [1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2], [1, 3], [3, 1] = 7 paths
// N = 5 -> [....] = 13 paths
// Brute: Make recursive calls to values of 1, 2, and 3 being removed from N. When it reaches 0, we found a permutation. Return that list, and continue again for the next number.
// N = 3
// f(3); i = 1; 3 - 1 = 2           [1]
//          i = 1; 2 - 1 = 1         [1]

//              Can we go to (3, 3)? Yes. go there. Is it the last grid position? Yes. We are done.
// Returning true ensures that the recursion does NOT keep going even after finding a solution.

// It's possible that the robot might visit a square that it previously has before if the path guides them there again. We can keep a reference.
